      <h3 id="toc_2">Q1. How do I create a fund?</h3>

      <p><strong>A1.</strong> A fund can be created in 4 simple steps.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>1.</strong>
        Click on the &quot;+ Create fund&quot; icon to create a new fund. Then, choose an appropriate [Name] (no
        character limits) to attribute to the future fund.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>2.</strong>
        Decide and select which assets you&#39;d like to include in your fund by sliding &quot;right&quot; under the
        [Composition] column. Set a weight to each asset.
      </p>

      <p><strong>3.</strong> Assign a [Risk Rating] to the fund and add a [Description].</p>

      <p><strong>4.</strong> [Launch] the fund!</p>

      <h3 id="toc_3">Q2. How many underlying assets can I select in a fund?</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>A2.</strong>
        Currently, in the first phase of the DEXTF mainnet release, a DEXTF fund can hold a maximum of 10 assets. We
        expect to increase the limit gradually and to eventually enable the creation of fund of funds.
      </p>

      <h3 id="toc_4">Q3. What are the available assets that can be used in a fund?</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>A3.</strong>
        Currently, the available assets are:
      <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>Swappable on Kyber Network (see <a href="https://tracker.kyber.network/#/tokens" target="kyber">here</a>
          for a full list):
          <br />
          AMPL, BAT, BNT, COMP, DAI, KNC, LEND, LINK, LRC, MKR, MLN, QNT, REN, RSR, SNX, UNI, USDC, USDT, WBTC,
          WETH, YFI, ZRX

        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Currently non-swappable on Kyber Network:
          <br />BAL, UMA
        </li>
      </ul>
      We will be releasing more and more assets in the next weeks (<a href="mailto:support@dextf.com">let us know</a>
      if you have any preference). We expect to include all asset types, as tokenization efforts continue, including
      real world assets such as equity, debt,
      options etc. Stay tuned!
      </p>

      <h3 id="toc_5">Q4. Can I create a fund with 1 underlying asset?</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>A4.</strong>
        No, the minimum is 2 assets. We expect to enable a fund of funds, which will still require a minimum of 2 funds.
      </p>

      <h3 id="toc_6">Q5. What does the &quot;symbol&quot; represent in a fund?</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>A5.</strong>
        The symbol is a unique identifier that represents the fund on the platform&#39;s database. The limit is
        currently set at 3 alphanumeric characters
      </p>

      <h3 id="toc_7">Q6. Does the risk rating influence any price or calculation in a fund?</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>A6.</strong>
        No, at the moment the risk rating is purely to inform the investor of the fund&#39;s overall risk rating based
        on assets&#39; composition. However, we expect that it may be used for risk analytics purposes.
      </p>

      <h3 id="toc_8">Q7. After creating a fund on the platform, it is not visible for an investor, why?</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>A7.</strong>
        After a fund is created on the platform, it needs to be launched on the blockchain to be visible by investors.
        Please make sure that you have completed this step.
      </p>

      <h3 id="toc_9">Q9. How/Where can I define the management fee?</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>A8.</strong>
        At the moment the platform does not have management fees and this feature will be developed soon.
      </p>

      <h2 id="toc_10" class="ui header">INVESTOR</h2>

      <h3 id="toc_11">Q1. Can I use a fiat currency (i.e. USD, EUR) to invest in a fund?</h3>

      <p><strong>A1.</strong> No, our platform currently can only accept digital currencies.
      </p>

      <h3 id="toc_12">Q2. Which (stablecoins) digital currencies can I currently use to invest in a fund?</h3>

      <p><strong>A2.</strong> Our platform currently accepts DAI for new investments.</p>

      <h3 id="toc_13">Q3. How many wallets does your platform support?</h3>

      <p><strong>A3.</strong>
        At the moment we only support Metamask. We are working to integrate new wallets in the future.</p>

      <h3 id="toc_14">Q4. I do not own any of the underlying assets in my wallet but I want to buy a share of the fund,
        what
        should I do?</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>A4.</strong>
        Our platform is integrated with Kyber Network (a decentralized exchange) which allows you to invest in a fund
        using DAI and buy the underlying assets on Kyber, through our platform, in a single transaction. Therefore, as
        long as you own sufficient DAI, you&#39;ll be able to complete the subscription into the fund.
      </p>

      <h3 id="toc_15">Q5. I do not own all the underlying assets in my wallet but I have some and not enough to buy my
        target quantity, what should I do?</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>A5.</strong>
        Please refer to A4. In view of our Kyber integration you can swap the balance quantity required to subscribe to
        the fund without moving away from the platform.
      </p>

      <h3 id="toc_16">Q6. Can I buy less than 1 token of a fund?</h3>

      <p><strong>A6.</strong> Yes, XTF fund tokens are divisible in less than 1 unit.</p>

      <h3 id="toc_17">Q7. Can I access the assets in the Safe at a later stage for future investments?</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>A7.</strong>
        Yes, this is indeed the purpose of the Safe, which is to allow investors to keep the funds available for future
        subscriptions/investment without withdrawing the assets back into the wallet.
      </p>

      <h3 id="toc_18">Q8. Can I use a different exchange to purchase the underlying assets of a fund?</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>A8.</strong>
        No, at the moment our platform is integrated with Kyber but we are planning to add more exchanges in the future.
      </p>

      <h3 id="toc_19">Q9. What is a market slippage when using Kyber Swap?</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>A9.</strong>
        The slippage is the difference between the price a transaction was executed and the price it was requested. On
        our platform you can decide to accept any market slippage or set a predefined amount in which case a transaction
        will be executed only if the slippage is less than your preset amount.
      </p>

      <h3 id="toc_20">Q10. How do I calculate the required quantity of assets to invest in the fund?</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>A10.</strong>
        Given the XTF tokens quantity you&#39;d like to buy in the [Instructions] tab, click on the revolving arrow icon
        next to [Required Quantity] column to obtain the required amount.
